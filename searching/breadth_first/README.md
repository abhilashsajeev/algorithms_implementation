# Breadth First Search

> Also known as shortest path search

Breadth-first search allows you to find the shortest distance 
between two things. But shortest distance can mean a lot of 
things! You can use breadth-first search to

- Write a spell checker (fewest edits from your 
misspelling to a real wordâ€”for example, READED -> 
READER is one edit)
- Find the doctor closest to you in your network
- Build a search engine crawler
- Face book mutual friend
